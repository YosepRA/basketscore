# Basket Score Management App

This is the app that will be used for people who update a basketball match's scoresheet behind the scene. 

It's created using React. The initial goal for this project is to create the UI with a bigger goal in mind to actually integrate it with a backend system and implement a full app for both score manager who will manage the scoresheet and users who will get the result.
